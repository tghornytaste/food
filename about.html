        <div><p>This is a I website created for Vince sacks LTD located at Thika with an address P O Box 912-01000 Thika. The website that I will <BR>
          create will change the tradition way of doing business and advertising a company.<BR>
             This will be more advance comparing to the traditional<BR>
               way managing a company using ledger book and the<BR>
                 use of simple computer programs like Microsoft excel and Microsoft access and depending on the people you know to get customers and advertising your business. By the introduction of my website, it will lead to more customers as the business is advertised and customers can serve themselves 24 hours of a day by being able to make orders online, the company has grown to fast over the years and now is the right time for the company to switch from old fashion ways of management, advertising and storing of data to the modern and more technology advanced ones. This website will be very helpful to the company.
          Vince sacks LTD started on 2015 by its core founder Augustine Kizimula who was a car driver at Thika.<BR>
             This is after he saw a very high demand on goods transportation and storing. At the beginning the<BR>
          company was only suppling goods from the village to some small business owners in the Thika market <BR>
         approximate of seven people were the only ones using the service. It started with only one driver <BR>
         who was himself Mr. Kazimula at the time.<br>
         After the demand continue to grow, he rented a place to store the transported<BR>
         goods before being distributed do he hired a secretary that was staying at<BR>
           the stores collecting data and checking for the check ins and check out of<BR>
       the goods at the moment the system that was used was ledger books for storing<BR>
         data and relay on friends for marketing the business. After some years the<BR>
           company expanded which needed them to expand their store hiring four men for carrying the <BR>
          goods and another driver for transporting which led them to rent one car for more goods transportation.<br>
           The company didn’t stop to grow more people were hired and the service became bigger leading them<BR>
             to start using ledger books and Microsoft excel for data storing and burners for marketing.<BR>
           The company bought another two cars making the total of three cars that they own and four more <BR>
          rental cars in the year 2020 Now the company has a total of nine cars owed by <BR>
            themselves four rental cars and more other cars from the outside using the stores and <BR>
              the service of Vince sacks LTD.
